goal: improve the health insurance industry by providing better care and offerings to its patients

data: 
- cdc 2017-2018 annual survey
- 'data/case_study.csv' (tsv)

stakeholders: Chief Analytics Officer and Chief Marketing Officer

key questions: 

1) How does health status, represented by average number of days with bad physical health in the past month (PHYSHLTH), differ by state?

2) Digging deeper into the data, what are some factors that impact health (demographics, behaviors, etc.)?

notes:
Prior to each statistical test, you will need to perform some data preparation, which could include:

* Filtering out rows with irrelevant values
* Transforming data from codes into human-readable values
* Binning data to transform it from numeric to categorical
* Creating new columns based on queries of the values in other columns

EDA/Cleaning:

PHYSHLTH column: 
 - 1 row not asked or missing
 - Column: 91-92
 - Type of Variable: Num
 - SAS Variable Name: PHYSHLTH
 - Question Prologue:
 - Question: Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good?

POORHLTH
 - based on PHYSHLTH and MENTHLTH responses 
 - Section 02.01, PHYSHLTH, is 88 (aka no issues) and Section 2.02, MENTHLTH, is 88 (aka no issues)


For steps 2-5, you will need to select and execute an appropriate statistical test. Recall these tests we have learned so far:

1. Chi-squared test
- https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chi2_contingency.html
- used for comparing a categorical feature against a categorical feature, to determine whether they are independent

2. t-test
- https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html
- used for comparing two categories of a numeric feature, to determine whether their means are the same across categories

3. ANOVA
- https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.stats.anova.anova_lm.html#statsmodels.stats.anova.anova_lm
- used for comparing more than two categories of a numeric feature, to determine whether their means are the same across categories

### Requirements

#### 1. Prepare `PHYSHLTH` Data for Analysis

Using the data dictionary, ensure that you understand the meaning of the `PHYSHLTH` column. Then clean the data so that only valid records of `PHYSHLTH` remain.

#### 2. Describe the Distribution of Health Status by State

Does health status (`PHYSHLTH`) differ by state (`STATE_`)? If so, by how much, and is it statistically significant?

#### 3. Describe the Relationship between Health Status and Home Ownership Status

Does health status (`PHYSHLTH`) differ between home owners and renters (`RENTHOM1`)? If so, by how much, and is it statistically significant?

#### 4. Describe the Relationship between Chronic Sickness and Nicotine Use

Does chronic sickness (`PHYSHLTH >= 15`) differ based on nicotine use (various columns)? If so, by how much, and is it statistically significant?

#### 5. Choose Your Own Question
