# Website A/B Testing - Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll get another chance to practice your skills at conducting a full A/B test analysis. It will also be a chance to practice your data exploration and processing skills! The scenario you'll be investigating is data collected from the homepage of a music app page for audacity.

## Objectives

You will be able to:
* Analyze the data from a website A/B test to draw relevant conclusions
* Explore and analyze web action data

## Exploratory Analysis

Start by loading in the dataset stored in the file 'homepage_actions.csv'. Then conduct an exploratory analysis to get familiar with the data.

> Hints:
    * Start investigating the id column:
        * How many viewers also clicked?
        * Are there any anomalies with the data; did anyone click who didn't view?
        * Is there any overlap between the control and experiment groups? 
            * If so, how do you plan to account for this in your experimental design?


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('darkgrid')
%matplotlib inline

df = pd.read_csv('homepage_actions.csv')
print(len(df))
df.head()
```

    Overlap of experiment and control groups: 0

## Conduct a Statistical Test

Conduct a statistical test to determine whether the experimental homepage was more effective than that of the control group.


```python
df['count'] = 1
df.head()
```

## Verifying Results

One sensible formulation of the data to answer the hypothesis test above would be to create a binary variable representing each individual in the experiment and control group. This binary variable would represent whether or not that individual clicked on the homepage; 1 for they did and 0 if they did not. 

The variance for the number of successes in a sample of a binomial variable with n observations is given by:

## $n\bullet p (1-p)$

Given this, perform 3 steps to verify the results of your statistical test:
1. Calculate the expected number of clicks for the experiment group, if it had the same click-through rate as that of the control group. 
2. Calculate the number of standard deviations that the actual number of clicks was from this estimate. 
3. Finally, calculate a p-value using the normal distribution based on this z-score.

### Step 1:
Calculate the expected number of clicks for the experiment group, if it had the same click-through rate as that of the control group. 


```python
control_rate = control.click.mean()
expected_experiment_clicks_under_null = control_rate * len(experiment)
print(expected_experiment_clicks_under_null)
```

    838.0168067226891


### Step 2:
Calculate the number of standard deviations that the actual number of clicks was from this estimate.


```python
n = len(experiment)
p = control_rate
var = n * p * (1-p)
std = np.sqrt(var)
print(std)
```

    24.568547907005815



```python
actual_experiment_clicks = experiment.click.sum()
z_score = (actual_experiment_clicks - expected_experiment_clicks_under_null)/std
print(z_score)
```

    3.6625360854823588


### Step 3: 
Finally, calculate a p-value using the normal distribution based on this z-score.


```python
import scipy.stats as stats
p_val = stats.norm.sf(z_score) #or 1 - stats.norm.cdf(z_score)
print(p_val)
```

    0.00012486528006951198


### Analysis:

Does this result roughly match that of the previous statistical test?

> Comment: **Your analysis here**


```python
# Comment: Yes, while the p-value is slightly lower, 
# both would lead to confident rejection of the null hypothesis. 
# The experimental page appears to be a more effective design.
```

## Summary

In this lab, you continued to get more practice designing and conducting AB tests. This required additional work preprocessing and formulating the initial problem in a suitable manner. Additionally, you also saw how to verify results, strengthening your knowledge of binomial variables, and reviewing initial statistical concepts of the central limit theorem, standard deviation, z-scores, and their accompanying p-values.
