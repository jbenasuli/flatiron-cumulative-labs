So maybe there are {n^2} operations for 2 features, {n^4} operations for 4 features, etc. If we can reduce the number of dimensions (features) prior to fitting/predicting with the model, the model will be faster and use fewer computational resources (memory, processing power, etc.)\n", "2. **Improving model performance:** In some cases even if we had unlimited computational capacity, our models would still struggle to fit on data with too many dimensions, known as the *curse of dimensionality*.
